- location-based analytics (wireless) 
- spaces arch: data from different sources, variegated  (webex, switches, )
- position of a user in a room 
- sensors: wifi, wired (e.g. temp) with a EP getway (BLE and then into cloud space solution) 
- use cases: behav anal (heatmaps with people navigation, real-time monitoring of users) 
- Firehose: rt data streaming of IoT telemetry, users 
 MARKET PLACE: use it to see supported stuff and use cases 
 C intelligent workspace 
 phone app -> map for navigation, find a room 
 example: use gpt to write and run some python code 
 extra third party data ?

 FILTERING: important not to overload ! 
 different streams, different data, filtering needed 
 location hi : new access points etc. 
 CHECK THE DOCS 
 WEBEX SPACE FOR PARTICIPANTS: api key for firehose API over this channel! 
 premi di merda 

questions: 
- API limitations 
18 different api keys, pay attention to event splitting 
- precision: location calculated on the cloud, depends on access points (5-10 meters) 
- historical data: on you, integrated with your db 
- sample data: preview of code done! check gh 
- information about the person: ip, mac, (e.g.) hash that to make it invisible 


USE CASE: new ideas, what business data can be combined to create new ideas! e.g. combine data from different sources
access point location: you have pos, it telemetry, probably yes 

PRIVACY: mac rand, hash information (!!!!) 
you have to allow us to see you


cosa esiste gi√†????


does poli do this??????
