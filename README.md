# StartHack2024
This repository contains three Python scripts that showcase the use of Syngenta APIs for the business use case proposed by Group 9 at Start Hack 2024. 
We are Computer Science and Engineering students from Politecnico di Milano and our names are Alessandro Mileto, Alessandro Cogollo, Tommaso Crippa, Pietro Morcavallo. 

# Examples
- avizio.py: running the command "python avizio.py" fetches risk factors relative to diseases and provides recommendations on how to treat plants.
- cal.py: running "python cal.py" provides some predictions on the evolution in time of the growth state of a plant.
- forecast.py: the script fetches weather forecasts and showcases how such data can be used in our use case to provide the user with recommendations on whether or not to water the plant.
